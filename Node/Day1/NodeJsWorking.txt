//Node.js is an open-source, event-driven JavaScript runtime that helps us build fast and scalable backend applications. 

⚙️ How Node.js Handles Asynchronous Tasks
Node.js is built using two main things:

1.V8 Engine
The JavaScript engine from Google Chrome.
Executes JavaScript code.
Converts JS into machine code.
Handles synchronous execution (running your JS).
Simple line for students:
V8 = “The brain that runs JavaScript.”

2.libuv (Library UV)
A C library used by Node.js to handle asynchronous operations.
It manages:
File system operations
Network requests
Timers (setTimeout, setInterval)
Event loop
Thread pool
Instead of blocking JS, libuv sends heavy tasks to the system and calls back when done.

Note:-libuv = “The worker that handles background tasks.”

Q.Why Node.js Needs libuv
JavaScript is single-threaded.
Without libuv:-Reading file → server freezes 😵
With libuv:Read file in background → server stays fast 🚀

//Conclusion:-
“Node.js uses the V8 engine to run JavaScript,
and libuv to handle asynchronous operations like file reading, APIs, and timers without blocking the main thread.”

Note:-
Event-Driven Architecture means the application responds to events instead of running everything sequentially.

1.Node.js is signle threaded and non blocking in nature 
2.Node.js doesn’t wait for slow operations like API calls, file reading, or database queries.
3.Instead:-
(a)It sends heavy tasks to the background (libuv).
(b)Continues running other code.
(c)Executes a callback when the task finishes.
Ex:-
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Async Task Done");
}, 2000);
console.log("End");

//Imp:-
Node.js is single-threaded because it runs JavaScript on one main thread, 
and non-blocking because it handles slow tasks asynchronously without freezing the application.
