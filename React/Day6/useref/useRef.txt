useRef:-
useRef is part of React's Hooks API, allowing developers to maintain a consistent reference to a value or a DOM element throughout the component's lifecycle.
It returns a mutable object with a .current property, which can be initialized with a value of any type.
Unlike state updates with useState, updates to a useRef value do not cause the component to re-render,
making it ideal for keeping track of values or DOM elements that do not directly impact the visual output of the component.

//Basic Syntax:-
Here's how to use useRef:

Importing useRef: import { useRef } from 'react';
Initialization: const myRef = useRef(initialValue);
Accessing Ref: Use myRef.current to access the stored value.

Q.Why is it useful?
useRef provides a way to persist values across renders without triggering re-renders, offering a performance benefit for certain operations like accessing DOM elements,
storing previous state for comparison, or keeping track of values that don't need to trigger visual updates. It's a critical tool for handling imperatives,
such as focus management or integrating with third-party DOM libraries.

Real World Examples :

Form Input Focus: Automatically focus a text input when a component loads.
Animation: Keep track of animation frames in a component.
Comparing Props: Compare current props with previous ones to decide on rendering logic.
Building Custom Element say a custom video player and managing it.
Storing interval ids and persist across re-renders.
Building custom components like Pin Component above.

Ex:-
import { useState, useRef } from "react";

// useRef also remembers value through re-renders;
// but does not trigger re-renders

const ButtonWithUseRef = () => {
  let ref = useRef(0);
  const [flag, setFlag] = useState(false);

  const handleClick = () => {
    ref.current = ref.current + 1;
    console.log(ref);
  };

  console.log("ButtonWithUseRef rendering...");
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count : {ref.current}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>BUTTON WITH USEREF</button>
      <br />
      <br />
      <button onClick={() => setFlag(!flag)}>{flag ? "TRUE" : "FALSE"}</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ButtonWithUseRef;
