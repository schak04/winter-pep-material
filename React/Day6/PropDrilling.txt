Props Drilling in React:-
Props drilling occurs when you need to pass data from a parent component down to deeply nested child components, 
potentially through multiple levels of components that do not need the data themselves.
It's like passing a message down a line of people where only the last person needs to hear it.
This approach can quickly become cumbersome and lead to tightly coupled code that is difficult to maintain.

Q.Why is it a problem?
Components become less generic and harder to reuse in other contexts because they rely on props passed down from their parents.
Risk of Missing Props: It's easy to forget to pass props through every level of the component tree, leading to runtime errors and bugs.

Q.What is Context API?
The Context API provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.
With Context, you can store "global" data that can be accessed by any component in the component tree, regardless of how deeply nested it is.

Q.Why is it useful?

Improves Code Maintainability: By avoiding props drilling, Context API makes your code more maintainable and the component tree cleaner.
Enhances Component Reusability: Components can consume context data directly without relying on props passed from parent components,
 making them more reusable across different parts of your application.

 //Conclusion
While props drilling can quickly become unmanageable in deep component trees, Context API offers a cleaner, more efficient solution for sharing "global" data across components.
Understanding when and how to use these tools is crucial for developing scalable and maintainable React apps.

Ex:-
function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("Raj");

  return <Parent name={name} />;
}

function Parent({ name }) {
  return <Child name={name} />;
}
function Child({ name }) {
  return <GrandChild name={name} />;
}
function GrandChild({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello I am Pratik {name}</h1>;
}
export default App;
