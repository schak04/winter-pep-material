Frontend vs Backend:-

//Frontend
The part of a website users can see and interact with.
Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, etc.
Runs in the browser.
Example: buttons, forms, images, product list UI.

Student analogy:
Frontend = The design and screen of a mobile app.

//Backend
The part that works behind the scenes.
Handles data, logic, authentication, APIs.
Built using Node.js, Express, Java, Python, PHP, etc.
Runs on a server.

Student analogy:
Backend = The brain that processes requests and sends data.

Q.What is a Server?
A server is a computer or program that provides services or data to other computers.
It listens for requests.
Processes them.
Sends responses back.

Example with Node.js:
Browser asks: “Give me products”
Node.js server sends product data (JSON).

Easy line for students:
Server = “A machine that waits for requests and responds.”

Q.What is a Client?
A client is anything that requests data from a server.
Ex:-
Web browser
Mobile app
React frontend

//Client–Server Model (Core Concept)
The client–server model is a system where:
Client sends a request.
Server processes it.
Server sends a response.

Ex:-
Real-Life Example 🍔
You (Client) order food.
Waiter takes order (Request).
Kitchen (Server) prepares food.
Food comes back (Response).

//3-Layer Client-Server Architecture

1.Presentation Layer (Frontend)
What users see.
React UI
HTML pages
Forms & buttons
Ex:-
Role:
Sends requests
Displays responses

2.Application Layer (Backend / Logic Layer)
Where Node.js comes in.
API routes
Business logic
Authentication
Data processing

3.Data Layer (Database)
Where data is stored.
MongoDB
MySQL
PostgreSQL
Ex:-
It Stores:-->
Users
Products
Orders
