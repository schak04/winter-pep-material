BE -> Server + Database (MongoDB)

   -> Server -> it's just another computer which serves;
  
    Customer ---> requesting  Salt ---> Server/Waiter should serve the salt;
    Customer ---> requesting  Sugar ---> Server/Waiter should serve the sugar;

In the case of the restaurant waiter, it's a human with brain to process the request and serve approproiately

But in the case of our computer server, we need to program the computer so that :
if the request is for salt, respond with salt and so on;
if the request is for /lectures, it should respond with lectures;
/assignments -> assignments;


BE -> Server + Database (MongoDB)

   -> Server -> it's just another computer which serves;
   -> Server side programming language (SSPL) + Framework/Library 
   -> Java + spring/springboot
   -> Python + Flask/Django
   -> Javascript + Express
   -> PHP + Laravel

   Python(X amount of time for learing this) + Django (Y amount of time) --> X + y time
   Java (X) + springboot(Y) ---> X + Y;
   Javascript (X) + Express(Y) ---> X + Y; We have already spent X time before unit 7, so what's left is Y amount of time;

You have already learnt react

NEM is left;

N - Node

What exactly is Node?

Javascript was meant only to run on the browser
HTML, CSS, Javascript +  A SSPL + frameworks

Ryan Dahl - why not make Javascript run outside the browser?
- came up with Node -> It helps run Javascript outside the browser;

**Node - It's just a runtime environment to run Javascript outside the browser**

If we want to swim - we require an environment where we can swim like beach, river -> swimming pool(swimtime environment)

Node -> JS Engine + a few more things 
     -> Chrome(V8 engine) 
     -> Mozilla firefox(spiderMonkey)


Node -> V8 engine + a few more things;


Node REPL - Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop

Modules

Import and Export

ESM way of importing exporting. ES6 came in 2015,node was created in 2009 
   import x from y;
   export deafult x;

CJS way of importing exporting
   var x = require(y)
   module.exports = x

Modules :-A module is a reusable block of code stored in a separate file.
1. Custom modules - where we create our own modules, write our own logic etc. Eg. calc.js;
2. Node inbuilt modules - which are already present in node. Eg. OS,fs,path,http
         https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/
3. External modules - some other devs wrote the code and published it online for us to use - npm packages
         There are close to ~ 13 lakh package

         Example : is-even, qrcode


// // ESM way : import add from "./calc.js"
// // CJS way;

// // custom modules
// const {add, sub} = require("./calc")


// const sum = add(2,3)
// const difference = sub(5,3)

// console.log(sum) // 5
// console.log(difference) // 2


// Node Inbuilt modules

// const os = require("os")

// console.log(os.networkInterfaces())
//console.log(os.userInfo());
//console.log(os.arch());
//console.log(os.cpus());
//console.log(os.platform());

// const fs = require("fs")


// fs.readFile("./dummy.txt", {encoding : "utf-8"}, (err, data) => {
//     console.log(data)
// })
// it is giving us data  but in hexadecimal value (ASCII value of each character in the file)
// so we give the encoding:"utf-8" in options, to get in readable format

//const path = require("path");
const filePath = path.isAbsolute("/data.txt");
console.log(filePath);
// External module

// const isEven = require("is-even")

// const result = isEven(6)

// console.log(result)

// Let's create a QR code?


// var QRCode = require('qrcode')

// QRCode.toFile("ourfirstqr.jpeg", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/nihal-ahmed-0101/")
